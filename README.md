# Pomodoro
This is a virtual Pomodoro Timer made using python.

The pomodoro timer helps with time management by splitting your work into individual 30 mins tasks which include 25 minutes of Work period and followed by a strict 5 Minutes Break! This pomodoro timer uses a simple python code that alternates over work and break cycles simply using system time. Do download the code and check it out. 

Note: The Alarm.mp3 is a sample audio file which has been used as alarm tone that goes on whenever a cycle completes. For successful execution the Alarm.mp3 file should placed in the same folder as the Pomodoro.py file or the .exe file whichever you intend to use.

Happy studies!!!!
